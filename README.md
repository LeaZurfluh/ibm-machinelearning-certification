# ibm-machinelearning-certification
Projects for Coursera's IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning).
This course comprises 6 modules listed below, for which we had to submit a project on a data set of our choice. 
Project instructions were voluntarily vague so that it allows for greater creativity in the output.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning
Data set chosen: Flavours of cacao. Aim: run an EDA.

2. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression
Data set chosen: Gender Pay Gap. Aim: predict salary with features such as gender, seniority level, job title.

3. Supervised Machine Learning: Classification
Data set chosen: Gender Pay Gap. Aim: predict gender with features such as salary, seniority level, job title.

4. Unsupervised Machine Learning
Data set chosen: Gender Pay Gap. Aim: add unsupervised classification models to Gender Prediction model defined in 3. in order to improve our model.

5. Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
Data set chosen: Flowers Recognition. Aim: run a convolutional neural network to predict flower label.

6. Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis
Data set chosen: Fake data set of sales of product A by country between 2013 and 2017. Aim: forecast sales.
